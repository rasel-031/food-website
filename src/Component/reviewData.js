    comment: `Dinner in the King and Prince's new restaurant-ECHO (open only 12 days)
        interesting menu, wonderful meal that was perfectly served by our waiter,
        Peter, who also filled us in on the local community. 
        Room service breakfast was exactly on time.`,

    comment: `Rachel at the Pool (drinks server) was so gorgeous.
        We chatted with her all weekend and she played with the kids.
        She's an asset to the hotel esp for people with families. 
        I saw other attendants playing with the kids too which is so welcoming. `,

    comment: `We had lunch here a few times while on the island visiting family and friends. 
        The servers here are just wonderful and have great memories it seems. We sat on the ocean
        front patio and enjoyed the view with our delicious wine and lunch. Must try!`,

    comment: `The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation,
        very pleasing. We especially enjoyed the special bar drinks, the cucumber/cilantro
        infused vodka martini and the K&P Aquarium was great
        (even took photos so we could try to replicate at home).`,
